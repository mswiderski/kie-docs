= Run business application
:imagesdir: ..

Once the application is created, next step is to actually run it.

== Launch application

By default business application has single runnable project - that is the service project. The service project is equipped with
two scripts (both for linux and windows)

* launch.sh/launch.bat
* launch-dev.sh/launch-dev.bat

the main difference between these two scripts is the target execution

* launch.sh/bat is dedicated to start application in standalone mode, without additional requirements.
* launch-dev.sh/bat is dedicated to start application in sort of development mode (in other words managed mode) so it will require workbench to be available as controller.

Development mode is meant to allow people to work on the business assets projects and dynamically deploy changes to the business application
without need to restart it. At the same time allows a complete monitoring environment over business automation capabilities (process instances,
  tasks, jobs, etc).

To launch your application just go into service project (_{your business application name}-service_)
and invoke

`./launch.sh clean install` for Linux/Unix

`./launch.bat clean install` for Windows

the `clean install` part of the command is to tell maven how to build. It will then
build projects in following order

* data model
* business assets
* service

the first time it might take a while as it will download all dependencies of the project.
At the end of the build it will start the application and after few seconds you should
see output similar to following..,

and you should be able to access your business application at http://localhost:8090/[http://localhost:8090/]

== Launch application in development mode

NOTE: Development mode require jbpm console to be available, by default at http://localhost:8080/jbpm-console
the easiest way to get that is to use jBPM single distribution that can be downloaded at http://jbpm.org[jbpm.org]
Look at the Getting Started guide to get yourself familiar with jbpm console.

Make sure you have jbpm console up and running before launching business
application in development mode.

=== Import your business assets project into jbpm console

Business assets projects that was just created can be easily imported into jbpm console
as soon as it's a valid git repository. To make it as such

* go into business assets project - _{your business application name}-kjar_
* execute `git init`
* execute `git add -A`
* execute `git commit -m "Initial project structure"`
* logon to workbench and go to projects
* select import project and enter following URL `file:///{path to your business application}/{your business application name}-kjar`
* click import and confirm project to be imported

=== Work on your business assets

Once the business assets project is imported into jbpm console you can start working on it.
Just go to the project and add assets such as business process, rules, decision tables etc.

=== Launch business application in development mode

To launch your application just go into service project (_{your business application name}-service_)
and invoke

`./launch-dev.sh clean install` for Linux/Unix

`./launch-dev.bat clean install` for Windows

this should print the first entry after the build as follows

`Launching the application in development mode - requires connection to controller (workbench)`

and similar as to launching in the standalone more after couple of seconds
should be able to access your business application at http://localhost:8090/[http://localhost:8090/]

Once the application started, it should be successfully connect to controller and by that
be visible in the servers perspective of jbpm console.

=== Deploy business assets project into running business application

After adding assets to your project in jbpm console you can just Deploy it to running server instance.
Just click the `Deploy` button on your project and in few seconds you should see the
project deployed on your business application.

You can use Process Definitions and Process Instance perspectives of jbpm console
to interact with your newly deployed business assets such as processes or user tasks.
